# IRATA
  
The name _IRATA_ refers to a wide range of Iranian Android trojans that, despite having different architectures and implementations, share similar goals and behaviors. However, due to the attribution of this name to various malware strains over time, _IRATA_ cannot be considered a single, well-defined malware family.

This category of malware typically steals victims' banking credentials and two-factor authentication codes through unauthorized access to their SMS messages. _IRATA_ is one of the most active malware categories in Iran and often deceives users under the guise of official or governmental services such as legal notifications, subsidies, Kalabarg, device registration (Hamta), and more.  

Different strains of _IRATA_ generally have the following common characteristics:  

1.  Most use **Firebase** as a C2(*) (sometimes hybridized with another C2).
    
2.  Most attempt unauthorized access to the user’s SMS messages.
    
3.  Most spread themselves by secretly sending SMS messages from the victim’s SIM card.
    
4.  Most are distributed via SMS.
    
5.  Their dedicated C2s are usually developed in **PHP** and follow a similar structure.
    
6.  Some _IRATA_ variants are developed using **basic4android**.
    
_* Newer and more advanced variants of IRATA use this method less frequently. This communication method is generally used by variants developed with basic4android._  

Early samples of _IRATA_ were observed in the early 2020s. Over time, some strains have undergone significant changes and improvements.  

The initial _IRATA_ variants developed with **basic4android** had very simple structures and continue to infect users. These strains have changed little over time, and most of their source code is copied from Iranian educational projects.  

Most _IRATA_ strains spread via SMS, use short-lived domains, and each strain includes numerous samples with varying appearances. These factors make discovering different samples of this malware particularly challenging.  

Due to the widespread use and diversity of some _IRATA_ strains—especially those developed with **basic4android**—it is suspected that the source code of certain variants has been sold to various cybercriminal groups.  
There have been reports of IRATA variants targeting Italian users in 2024.
